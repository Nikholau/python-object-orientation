# Object Orientation in Python

Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it allows you to define classes and objects. Classes are templates for creating objects, and objects are instances of classes. Here's a brief overview of some key concepts:

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of objects that belong to the class.

- **Object**: An instance of a class. It is a concrete entity based on a class and has its own state and behavior.

- **Inheritance**: The ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It allows you to create a new class based on an existing class.

- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It allows you to control access to the data.

- **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call. It allows you to use a unified interface for different data types.

# Main Variable Types

Python has several built-in variable types. Here are some of the main ones:

- **int**: Integer type, for whole numbers like 1, 2, -3, etc.
- **float**: Floating-point type, for numbers with a decimal point like 3.14, -0.5, etc.
- **str**: String type, for textual data like 'Hello', 'World', etc.
- **list**: List type, for ordered collections of items like [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'], etc.
- **tuple**: Tuple type, for ordered collections of items that cannot be changed (immutable) like (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c'), etc.
- **dict**: Dictionary type, for unordered collections of items that are accessed by keys like {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}, {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, etc.

# Functions

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses containing any arguments. Here's an example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print('Hello, ' + name)

greet('World')
```

This will output:

```
Hello, World
```

# Arithmetic Operators

Python supports several arithmetic operators for performing mathematical operations:

- **+**: Addition
- **-**: Subtraction
- *****: Multiplication
- **/**: Division
- **//**: Integer Division (returns the quotient without the remainder)
- **%**: Modulus (returns the remainder of the division)
- *****: Exponentiation (raises the left operand to the power of the right operand)

# Comparison Operators

Python supports several comparison operators for comparing values:

- **>**: Greater than
- **<**: Less than
- **==**: Equal to
- **!=**: Not equal to

# Assignment and Logical Operators

Python supports assignment operators for assigning values to variables, as well as logical operators for combining boolean expressions:

- **and**: Logical AND (returns True if both expressions are True)
- **or**: Logical OR (returns True if at least one expression is True)
- **not**: Logical NOT (returns True if the expression is False)
